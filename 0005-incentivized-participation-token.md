## Summary

It is proposed to issue and grant special tokens to addresses that mint PoS blocks and support peercoin by running nodes and contributing to the project. 

Apart from having collective value, these tokens may allow owners to participate in community votes and tipping in future.  

## Conventions
- The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Motivation

In order to motivate supporters of Peercoins to participate more often thereby increasing value and security of our network, it is proposed to regularly reward active participants with special peerasset tokens.

## Proposed process

### Creation

Peercoin foundation creates 1 million non divisible tokens of mode ONCE.

### Initial distribution

33% are transferred to developer fund multisig address,
33% are transferred to minter fund multisig address,
34% are transferred to supporter fund multisig address

### Continued distribution

minters get paid 1 token per block found

developers get paid 1 token per hour spent on project

supporters get paid 1 token per day on forum?

#### Implementation

### Use Case

#### Voting

Voting can be realised by weighted star rating or participating addresses.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Alternatives
